tar command. tar is a command-line utility that is used to create, manipulate,
and extract files from archives. One thing you may have noticed about tar and
other command line tools in Linux is that they often allow you to specify
parameters without the &amp;ndash; syntax commonly used in other systems. For example, in
Linux, you can create a tar archive using the following command:&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ChatGPT: The Revolutionary Chatbot Powered by GPT Technology</title><link>https://wlemuel.github.io/2023/03/03/chatgpt-the-revolutionary-chatbot-powered-by-gpt-technology/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Mar 2023 20:22:03 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://wlemuel.github.io/2023/03/03/chatgpt-the-revolutionary-chatbot-powered-by-gpt-technology/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="introduction">

&lt;p>The advancements in machine learning and natural language processing have taken
the world by storm. One of the most exciting applications of these technologies
is the development of chatbots, which can converse with humans in a natural
way. These chatbots come in various shapes and sizes, but ChatGPT stands out as
one of the best.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>ChatGPT is a chatbot that uses GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
technology to generate human-like responses to user inputs. GPT is a machine
learning model that has been pre-trained on a massive corpus of text data. This
pre-training allows GPT to generate coherent and contextually appropriate
responses to user inputs. ChatGPT builds on this technology to create a chatbot
that can carry out conversations with users in a natural and seamless way.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Custom Annotations in Java: Creating and using your own annotations</title><link>https://wlemuel.github.io/2023/02/09/custom-annotations-in-java-creating-and-using-your-own-annotations/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 18:26:21 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://wlemuel.github.io/2023/02/09/custom-annotations-in-java-creating-and-using-your-own-annotations/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="1-dot-introduction-to-annotations-in-java">

&lt;p>Annotations in Java are metadata that provide additional information about a
program element, such as a class, method, or field. Annotations are used to
provide information to the compiler or to other tools, such as code generators
or libraries, and can be used for a variety of purposes, including defining
access control, providing information about dependencies, or specifying runtime
behavior.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to Build Custom Container Images with Podman</title><link>https://wlemuel.github.io/2023/02/08/how-to-build-custom-container-images-with-podman/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Feb 2023 13:29:37 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://wlemuel.github.io/2023/02/08/how-to-build-custom-container-images-with-podman/</guid><description>&lt;p>Containers have become an increasingly popular tool for developers and sysadmins
to package and deploy applications in a scalable and efficient manner. One of
the key benefits of containers is that they allow for the creation of custom
images, which can be tailored to meet specific application requirements. In this
article, we will explore how to build custom container images using Podman, a
popular open-source tool for managing containers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>A container image is a lightweight, stand-alone, and executable package of
software that includes everything needed to run a piece of software, including
the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and system tools. Container
images are designed to be portable and can be run on any system that supports
containers, making it easy to deploy applications across multiple environments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Comparing Nginx and Caddy: Which Web Server is Right for Your Needs?</title><link>https://wlemuel.github.io/2023/02/03/comparing-nginx-and-caddy-which-web-server-is-right-for-your-needs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 03 Feb 2023 22:52:36 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://wlemuel.github.io/2023/02/03/comparing-nginx-and-caddy-which-web-server-is-right-for-your-needs/</guid><description>&lt;p>When it comes to choosing a web server, there are many options available, each

servers was displaying low disk utilization. To rectify the issue, I decided to
employ a strategy of decluttering by removing any redundant files, including
expired logs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to accomplish this task, I first established a secure remote connection
to the server using ssh. Then, I embarked on the following series of steps to
reclaim the precious disk space and restore optimal performance to my Linux
system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About Me</title><link>https://wlemuel.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 May 2020 11:49:22 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://wlemuel.github.io/about/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m &lt;strong>Steve Lemuel&lt;/strong>.
